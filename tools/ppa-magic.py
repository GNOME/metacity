Description: Lightweight GTK2 compositing window manager (nightly trunk)
 Metacity is a small window manager, using gtk2 to do everything.
 .
 As the author says, metacity is a "Boring window manager for the adult in
 you. Many window managers are like Marshmallow Froot Loops; Metacity is
 like Cheerios."
 .
 This is the nightly trunk upload.  It may not be the epitome of stability.
