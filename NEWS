2.8.8
==

This is a stable release for Gnome 2.8.2.

Thanks Rob Adams, Anders Carlsson, Elijah Newren, and Soeren Sandmann,
for fixes in this release.

Fixes
  * Correct the requested number of keycodes (Rob) [#155247]
  * Make the "showing desktop" mode be per-workspace instead of
    per-screen. (Elijah) [#142198]
  * Don't try to use an ARGB visual at all if the depth isn't
    32-bit. This caused major slowdowns with Composite
    enabled. (Anders)
  * Fix the modifier key breakage introduced by an Xorg
    change. (Soeren) [#151554]
  * Fix the alt-tab order--if the most recently used window is not
    focused, start alt tabbing with that window instead of the one
    after it (Elijah) [#156251]
  * Use only numbers from the Fibonacci sequence for micro version
    numbers at Havoc's request (thus the reason this is 2.8.8 instead
    of 2.8.7--2.8.4 and 2.8.6 were mistakes that didn't comply with
    this requirement)

Translations
  * da(Martin Willemoes Hansen), fr(Christophe Merlet, Baptiste Mille-Mathias)

2.8.6
==

This is a stable release for Gnome 2.8.1.

Thanks to the Ken Harris, Kjartan Maraas, and the tireless efforts of
Elijah Newren for fixes in this release.

Fixes
  * Ensure the correct window is focused when minimizing (Elijah)
  * Fix keynav with mouse focus (Elijah)
  * Fix several race conditions in window focusing (Elijah)
  * Focus the top window when lowering by frame click (Ken)
  * Fix some compiler warnings (Kjartan)
  * Fix some valgrind-reported errors (Elijah)
  * Fix some potential issues with autoraising windows (Elijah)

Translations
  * en_CA(Adam Weinberger), it(Luca Ferretti)

2.8.5
==

bug fixes since the last stable release.

2.8.4
==

This release features a number of bug fixes, and also the disabling of
the focus-stealing-prevention code (we're entering hard code freeze in
Gnome so it's too late to fix the remaining issues, especially since
it requires several patches to modules other than Metacity).

Thanks to Havoc Pennington, Soeren Sandmann, Elijah Newren, and Rich
Wareham for fixes in this release

Fixes
  * track the last_xor_rect, for wireframe painting (Havoc)
  * Move wireframe code before grab is released to prevent endless
    loops with fullscreen windows. (Soeren)
  * Make dialogs that Metacity shows follow focus-stealing-prevention
    conventions. (Elijah; part of #149028)
  * add render extension check to the display, don't build the
    compositing manager by default, use an ARGB visual when available
    for the window frame (Rich Wareham; various tweaks added later by
    Havoc)
  * move the have_xrender variable initialization up in the file since
    it can be set as part of composite check (Havoc)
  * make argb stuff compile, add some code from xcompmgr (Havoc)
  * fix an assertion failure that would occur after increasing the
    number of workspaces; fix stacking order when a window is denied
    focus (Elijah; #150615)
  * disable some compositor code that wasn't working, don't grab the
    server during repaint, various set_background fixes and
    refactoring (Havoc)

    more consistent (fixes #142235)

    (#131582), make focus choice consistent for each focus mode

    one.

    windows not being focused on unminimizing caused by original
