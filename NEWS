Thanks to Davyd Madeley and Elijah Newren for improvements in this release.

 - Differentiate between movement towards an edge and movement away from
   one for edge-resistance.  Pick smaller constants for movement away from
   an edge (Elijah)
 - Use GPOINTER_TO_INT() macro instead of cast to allow compilation on
   64-bit architectures without warning (Davyd)
 - compute the frame geometry due to maximization only after actually
   maximizing (Elijah) [#321902]
 - add some developer documentation on updating struts, workareas, regions,
   and edges (Elijah)
 - When updating the xinerama due to placement, update which
   maximal/spanning rect set to use as well (Elijah) [#322068]
 - Relax the partially onscreen constraint to allow the titlebar to touch
   the bottom panel in order to make the new constraints code function the
   same as the old version (Elijah) [#322071]
 - Don't allow removing a window from maximized or fullscreened state to
   place the titlebar under the top panel (Elijah) [#322075]

2.13.2
==

This release just contains a merge of all the changes on the
constraints_experiments branch.

Thanks to Havoc Pennington for reviewing the gargantuan patch and
suggesting lots of little fixes for making it better, to Rob Adams and
Soeren Sandmann for grilling me on how some of the difficult internals work
-- allowing me to improve the documentation, to Olav Vitters for finding an
easy-to-fix crasher bug in early testing and for repeatedly extending my
deadline for switching from working on Metacity to Bugzilla, to Ray Strode
for finding two crashers and fixing one of them in early testing, to Bryan
Clark for usability advice, to Davyd Madeley and Christian Kellner for
testing Xinerama stuff, to Sebastien Bacher for packaging an early version
and finding some obscure bugs (that I unfortunately still can't duplicate
and will probably still need to fix once I can),

Bugs fixed:
  unfiled - constraints.c is overly complicated[1]
  unfiled - constraints.c is not robust when all constraints cannot
            simultaneously be met (constraints need to be prioritized)
  unfiled - keep-titlebar-onscreen constraint is decoration unaware (since
            get_outermost_onscreen_positions() forgets to include
            decorations)
  unfiled - keyboard snap-moving and snap-resizing snap to hidden edges
    86644 - resize should have a shift option like move does
   109553 - gravity w/ simultaneous move & resize doesn't work
   113601 - maximize vertical and horizontal should toggle and be
            constrained
   122196 - windows show up under vertical panels
   122670 - jerky/random resizing of window via keyboard[2]
   124582 - keyboard and mouse snap-resizing and snap-moving erroneously
            moves the window multidimensionally
   136307 - don't allow apps to resize themselves off the screen (*cough*
            filechooser *cough*)
   142016, 143784 - windows should not span multiple xineramas unless
            placed there by the user
   143145 - clamp new windows to screensize and force them onscreen, if
            they'll fit
   144126 - Handle pathological strut lists sanely[3]
   149867 - fixed aspect ratio windows are difficult to resize[4]
   152898 - make screen edges consistent; allow easy slamming of windows
            into the left, right, and bottom edges of the screen too.
   154706 - bouncing weirdness at screen edge with keyboard moving or
            resizing
   156699 - avoid struts when placing windows, if possible (nasty a11y
            blocker)
   302456 - dragging offscreen too restrictive
   304857 - wireframe moving off the top of the screen is misleading
   308521 - make uni-directional resizing easier with alt-middle-drag and
            prevent the occasional super annoying resize-the-wrong-side(s)
            behavior
   312007 - snap-resize moves windows with a minimum size constraint
   312104 - resizing the top of a window can cause the bottom to grow
   319351 - don't instantly snap on mouse-move-snapping, remove
            braindeadedness of having order of releasing shift and
            releasing button press matter so much

   [1] fixed in my opinion, anyway.
   [2] Actually, it's not totally fixed--it's just annoying
       instead of almost completely unusable.  Matthias had a
       suggestion that may fix the remainder of the problems (see
       http://tinyurl.com/bwzuu).
   [3] This bug was originally about not-quite-so-pathological
       cases but was left open for the worse cases. The code from
       the branch handles the remainder of the cases mentioned in
       this bug.
   [4] Actually, although it's far better there's still some minor
       issues left: a slight drift that's only noticeable after
       lots of resizing, and potential problems with partially
       onscreen constraints due to not clearing any
       fixed_directions flags (aspect ratio windows get resized in
       both directions and thus aren't fixed in one of them)
        
New feature:
  81704 - edge resistance for user move and resize operations; in
          particular 3 different kinds of resistance are implemented:
     Pixel-Distance: window movement is resisted when it aligns with an
       edge unless the movement is greater than a threshold number of
       pixels
     Timeout: window movement past an edge is prevented until a certain
       amount of time has elapsed during the operation since the first
       request to move it past that edge
     Keyboard-Buildup: when moving or resizing with the keyboard, once a
       window is aligned with a certain edge it cannot move past until the
       correct direction has been pressed enough times (e.g. 2 or 3 times)

Major code changes:
  - constraints.c has been rewritten; very few lines of code from the old
    version remain.  There is a comment near the top of the function
    explaining the basics of how the new framework works.  A more detailed
    explanation can be found in doc/how-constraints-works.txt
  - edge-resistance.[ch] are new files implementing edge-resistance.
  - boxes.[ch] are new files containing low-level error-prone functions
    used heavily in constraints.c and edge-resistance.c, among various
    places throughout the code.  testboxes.c contains a thorough testsuite
    for the boxes.[ch] functions compiled into a program, testboxes.
  - meta_window_move_resize_internal() *must* be told the gravity of the
    associated operation (if it's just a move operation, the gravity will
    be ignored, but for resize and move+resize the correct value is needed)
  - the craziness of different values that
    meta_window_move_resize_internal() accepts has been documented in a
    large comment at the beginning of the function.  It may be possible to
    clean this up some, but until then things will remain as they were
    before--caller beware.
  - screen and xinerama usable areas (i.e. places not covered by
    e.g. panels) are cached in the workspace now, as are the screen and
    xinerama edges.  These get updated with the workarea in
    src/workspace.c:ensure_work_areas_validated()

2.9.0
==

This is an unstable release heading towards Gnome 2.10.

Thanks to Rob Adams, Anders Carlsson, Elijah Newren, Soeren Sandmann,
and Vincent Untz for fixes and features in this release.

 - Add a keybinding to launch a terminal (Vincent) [#154232]
 - Correct the requested number of keycodes (Rob) [#155247]
 - Add tracker bugs to rationales.txt file
 - Make the "showing desktop" mode be per-workspace instead of
   per-screen. (Elijah) [#142198]
 - Don't try to use an ARGB visual at all if the depth isn't
   32-bit. This caused major slowdowns with Composite
   enabled. (Anders)
 - Fix the modifier key breakage introduced by an Xorg
   change. (Soeren) [#151554]
 - Update _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN so the pager on the panel will know
   whether to display windows as visible or hidden (Elijah) [#105665]
 - Fix the alt-tab order--if the most recently used window is not
   focused, start alt tabbing with that window instead of the one
   after it (Elijah) [#156251]
 - Don't lower newly mapped windows when they're denied focus if they
   are transients of the focused window.  Instead, defocus the
   currently focused window (Elijah) [#151996]
 - Re-enable focus stealing prevention (Elijah)

2.8.4
==

This release features a number of bug fixes, and also the disabling of
the focus-stealing-prevention code (we're entering hard code freeze in
Gnome so it's too late to fix the remaining issues, especially since
it requires several patches to modules other than Metacity).

Thanks to Havoc Pennington, Soeren Sandmann, Elijah Newren, and Rich
Wareham for fixes in this release

Fixes
  * track the last_xor_rect, for wireframe painting (Havoc)
  * Move wireframe code before grab is released to prevent endless
    loops with fullscreen windows. (Soeren)
  * Make dialogs that Metacity shows follow focus-stealing-prevention
    conventions. (Elijah; part of #149028)
  * add render extension check to the display, don't build the
    compositing manager by default, use an ARGB visual when available
    for the window frame (Rich Wareham; various tweaks added later by
    Havoc)
  * move the have_xrender variable initialization up in the file since
    it can be set as part of composite check (Havoc)
  * make argb stuff compile, add some code from xcompmgr (Havoc)
  * fix an assertion failure that would occur after increasing the
    number of workspaces; fix stacking order when a window is denied
    focus (Elijah; #150615)
  * disable some compositor code that wasn't working, don't grab the
    server during repaint, various set_background fixes and
    refactoring (Havoc)
