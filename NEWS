2.6.3

Thanks to Rob Adams for contributions to this release.

 - fix to right, left, bottom onscreen resize constraints
 - detect case where we fail to get a pointer grab when the mouse 
   is clicked, to avoid "this window is stuck to my mouse!"
 - keep panels at the end of the focus MRU list so we don't 
   focus them all the time in annoying ways

   no longer works with GNOME 1.x

   between Xinerama heads or whatever

2.5.2
===

 Thanks to David Santiago, Julien Olivier, Anders Carlsson, Rob Adams
 for fixes in this release.

 - improved wording/UI for some dialogs
 - while clicking a window button, if you move the mouse outside 
   the button such that releasing the mouse button won't activate 
   the window button, visually indicate by "popping out" the button.
 - fix some valgrind errors
 - change "show desktop mode" to convert to "everything is minimized
   mode" if you open a new window while showing desktop, rather 
   than previous behavior of simply leaving show desktop mode.
 - fix a trivial memory leak
 - change "move to workspace N" so it doesn't switch workspaces, 
   just moves the window.
 - translation updates

2.5.1
===

 Thanks to Rob Adams, Peter O'Shea, Dafydd Harries, Masahiro Sakai,

2.5.0
===

 Thanks to Rob Adams, Owen Taylor, Frederic Crozat, Arvind Samptur,
 Bill Haneman, Akira Tagoh for help with fixes in this release.

 - many new translations
 - fix an infinite loop while holding a server grab triggered by 
   some recent Qt versions doing weird stuff
 - fix bug where Alt+rightclick repeatedly on titlebar resulted 
   in zillions of menus
 - fix Alt+Tab to *actually* put minimized windows at the end, 
   though this was always intended
 - rewrite size/positions constraint code (currently known 
   to be quite buggy, e.g. xmms is hosed)
 - enforce size of at least 1x1 on windows
 - reduce latency of managing new windows still further 
   by using async properties code in more places
 - don't grab keybindings on docks, so gnome-panel 
   can handle them
 - suck in the panel's screenshot and run dialog global 
   bindings
 - lots of improvements to window placement
 - sync max number of workspaces with pager applet
 - fix to keep focus when inside window frame in 
   strict mouse focus mode
 - make it possible to start a reverse tab with 
   shift+alt+tab (vs. alt+tab then shift)
 - fix a multihead issue with constraints between two 
   windows on different heads
 - require GTK+ 2.2.0 and fontconfig
 - default theme is now Simple
 - add visual bell feature
 - incorporate many fixes from 2.4.34

2.4.13
===

 - we were making all dialogs skip the taskbar, even non-transient 
   ones, though this was supposedly fixed a while ago. Now really
   fixed.
 - change back to Alt+click by default for the window drag feature.
 - assign Alt+F12 to shade window
 - fix not deleting enough workspaces when the number 
   was reduced via the pager config dialog (readams@hmc.edu)
 - don't allow windows under the top panel ever, even if they 
   are tall windows (Arvind)
 - fix up the window layout for directional workspace nav, 
   so you always stop at the edges and always end up 
   where you expect (hp, with tweaks from readams@hmc.edu)
 - focus new windows in mouse focus mode (readams@hmc.edu)
 - support xeyes, oclock, etc. by applying shape mask 
   to the window manager frame (yeah it resizes slow, deal)
 - fix vertical/horizontal maximize
 - handle crossing events resizing for more opaque resize goodness
   (Soeren)
 - add wacky _METACITY_UPDATE_COUNTER experimental extension 
   to do nice opaque resizing (does nothing without a GTK patch)
 - fix a crash setting workspace names
 - fix internationalized WM_NAME reading
